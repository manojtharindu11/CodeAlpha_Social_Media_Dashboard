# Social Media Dashboard

This project is a Social Media Dashboard that aggregates and displays feeds from multiple social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. The dashboard provides a unified view of social media activity, making it easy to monitor and engage with content from different platforms.

## Features

- Facebook Feed Integration
- Twitter Feed Integration
- LinkedIn Feed Integration

## *Facebook Feed Integration*

*The Facebook feed is fetched using the Facebook Graph API. The `facebookFeed.js` script handles the API requests and dynamically updates the DOM with the retrieved posts. To fetch your own Facebook feed, replace the `accessToken` variable in `facebookFeed.js` with a valid access token.*
